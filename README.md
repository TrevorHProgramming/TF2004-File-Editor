# TF2004-File-Editor

Current version: 0.6.6

An editor for the various proprietary file formats used in Transformers (2004) (PS2). 

This program will be able to convert model, texture, and other binary files used in Transformers to a more conventional form so they can be edited and converted back to the game's files. So far there are three file types that are understood well enough for this to be a possibility. 

A background image is supported but not currently in this repo. Any "background.png" kept in an "Assets" folder in the same directory as the exe will work.

File types:

VBIN: Most likely "Vertex Binary". The game's model files for characters. Models can be converted into STL or DAE depending on the details needed. Animation data is still being researched.

VBIN.Mesh: The game's model files for levels. These are structured significantly differently from standard VBIN files, being streamlined for the PS2 vertex engines and microcode capability. Most aspects of these files are now understood, but there are small sections that still require research. 

ITF: Might be "Infogrames Texture Format/File". The game's texture files, fairly similar to standard .BMPs. 

TMD, BMD, BDB, TDB: "Text Defintion," "Binary Definition," "Binary Database," "Text Database." Stores a significant amount of data used by the game. The definition file contains data types and default values for their corresponding database files, and as such are required to be opened before database files and some other definition files. This program can read all of these file types. Values for individual items can be edited, instances of objects can be removed, and the changed file can be saved as a usable MD/DB file. The addition of new classes or instances is not currently available. 

TLA, TLB, VAC: Compressed audio libraries. TLB files contain a text list of sound effects and their properties, and reference a matching .vac file to pull the audio information from. TLA files contain both the audio data normally present in a .vac and a binary list of the sound effects and their properties. Currently this program does not support these files, but they should be relatively simple to add when the time comes.
